## Usage

### In Trip Planning Chat
```typescript
// The timeline is automatically included in TripChat
<TripChat trip={trip} onUpdate={onUpdate} />
```

### Standalone Component
```typescript
import { ActivityTimeline } from '@/components/trips/planning/ActivityTimeline';

<ActivityTimeline
  dayContext={dayContext}
  onAddActivity={(timeSlot) => {
    // Handle adding activity to time slot
    console.log(`Add activity from ${timeSlot.start} to ${timeSlot.end}`);
  }}
  onEditActivity={(activity) => {
    // Handle editing existing activity
    console.log(`Edit activity: ${activity.name}`);
  }}
/>
```

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure
```
ActivityTimeline.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ Timeline Grid (6 AM - 11 PM)
â”œâ”€â”€ Activity Blocks (positioned by time)
â”œâ”€â”€ Free Time Slots (clickable areas)
â”œâ”€â”€ Meal Zone Indicators
â”œâ”€â”€ Current Time Line
â””â”€â”€ Summary Footer
```

### Props Interface
```typescript
interface ActivityTimelineProps {
  dayContext: DayContext;
  onAddActivity: (timeSlot: TimeSlot) => void;
  onEditActivity: (activity: Activity) => void;
}
```

### Time Calculations
- Activities positioned using CSS `top` based on start time
- Height calculated from duration (1 minute = 1 pixel)
- Free slots calculated from gaps between activities

## User Experience

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Activities**: Prominent colored blocks with icons
2. **Free Time**: Dashed borders, less prominent
3. **Conflicts**: Red ring animation draws attention
4. **Current Time**: Subtle but visible red line

### Interactions
- **Hover**: Tooltips with full details
- **Click**: Context-appropriate actions
- **Visual Feedback**: Smooth transitions and animations

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Drag-and-drop to reschedule activities
- [ ] Multi-day view option

- [ ] Real-time collaboration indicators
- [ ] Activity grouping/categories
- [ ] Export timeline as image/PDF
