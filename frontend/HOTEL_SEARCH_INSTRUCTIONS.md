# How to Search for Hotels in Trip Planning Chat

## Quick Start - What to Type

### 1. Basic Hotel Search
Type one of these commands in the chat:
- "Find hotels in [city name]"
- "Show me accommodations for my trip"
- "I need a hotel for 4 nights"
- "Find places to stay near [landmark]"

### 2. Specific Hotel Search
For better results, include details:
- "Find 4-star hotels in downtown Paris under $200/night"
- "Show me family-friendly hotels with pools"
- "Find boutique hotels near the Eiffel Tower"
- "I need pet-friendly accommodations"

### 3. Budget-Specific Searches
- "Find budget hotels under $100/night"
- "Show me luxury hotels with spa services"
- "Find mid-range hotels with breakfast included"

## Important: Getting Selectable Results

For the AI to return hotels you can select and save, use these specific phrases:

### ✅ GOOD - Will show selectable hotels:
- "Create an itinerary with hotels for each night"
- "Plan my trip including accommodations"
- "Add hotels to my itinerary"
- "Find and add hotels for Day 1"

### ❌ NOT IDEAL - Will just describe hotels:
- "Tell me about hotels" (too vague)
- "What hotels are good?" (no structure)

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Open Trip Planning Chat**
   - Go to your trip
   - Click on "Plan" or "Planning"
   - Select the "Chat" tab

2. **Type Your Hotel Request**
   Example: "Find hotels in Rome for my 4-night stay and add them to my itinerary"

3. **Wait for AI Response**
   The AI should return hotels in a structured format with:
   - Hotel names
   - Descriptions
   - Type marked as "accommodation"
   - Pricing information

4. **Select Hotels**
   - Look for the "View & Select Activities" button
   - Click to expand the list
   - Check the boxes next to hotels you want
   - Click "Save Selected Activities"

## Example Prompts That Work Well

```
"Please find 3 hotel options for my trip and format them as activities I can add to my itinerary"

"Create a day-by-day plan including hotel accommodations for each night"

"I need hotels near the city center. Please show them as accommodation activities for my itinerary"

"Find family-friendly hotels with breakfast included and add them as accommodation options"
```

## Troubleshooting

If hotels aren't showing up as selectable:
1. Make sure to ask for them to be "added to itinerary" or "formatted as activities"
2. Specify the number of nights
3. Mention your destination city
4. Ask for them to be marked as type "accommodation"

## Alternative: Use Activity Search

You can also use the Activity Search modal:
1. Click "Add Activity" button in the itinerary
2. In the search box, type "hotels" or a specific hotel name
3. Select "Accommodation" from the activity type filter
4. Search and add hotels directly
